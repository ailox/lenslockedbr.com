LensLockedBR.com
================

This is my personal implementation of lenslocked.com from the [Web Development with Go](https://www.usegolang.com/) course by [Jon Calhoun](https://www.calhoun.io/).

It's a great course that teaches you how to build a web application from the ground up using Go, Bootstrap and Mailgun.

I've had some basic knowledge of Go and this course helped me a lot to improve the way I'll code my next projects.
